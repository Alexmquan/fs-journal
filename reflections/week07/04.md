## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this week's readings did you implement?

If the partner project that is being referenced in this post is the World travel blog last week then some of the principles from this weeks readings that we used were pair programming where we took turns "driving", while the other person was watching and making callouts and looking up information.

2. What went well this week?

This week went very well for me I think. I was able to get ahead on my project by spending more time at home on the first days working on it and by the end of the week I had my project done early. I was able to get my page to be reactive on all changes made without having to do a hard refresh on the page which was a a goal for me. 

3. What would you do differently?

I think this week I would have spent a little more time working out problems and trying different possible solutions. Perhaps I would've done a better job on styling my page or tried a stretch goal or 2.
