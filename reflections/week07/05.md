## Prompts
- What went well this week?

- What would you count as a victory?

This week went well for me I think. The checkpoint we had over the weekend was tough for me because I waited until sunday to get it done and it ended up as hackathon 2.0 for me.It would've been much easier for me if I would've gotten more done the prior days. I probably underestimated how long it would take for me to get it done and it cost me. But I feel like the struggles I had over the weekend prepared me for the checkpoint we had during the week. The concepts came easier to me and because I put so much work towards the end of the weekend, I put in a lot of time right away when we got our checkpoint on tuesday and I feel like that put me much further ahead. Procrastination is not my friend.
