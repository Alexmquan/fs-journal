## Questions

1. What is a ***Base64 encoded image***?

A base64 encoded image is an an image that has been embedded directly into the html or css and by doing so, reduces the need for constant request being made to the server. They simply use an already open HTTP connection. 

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 encoding?

It will increase the size of the file which in turn will increase the amount of bandwidth needed and increase the download time.Since the Base64 encoded images are well, encoded, the CPU will be used more due to the need to now encode AND decode these images. Another issue is teh issue with caching. The images are unable to be cached on a users browser locally and will need to be pulled from the server which also increases the necessary bandwidth needed. 

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

These issues are a problem more so today than before because multiplexing was not a thing back then. Now we can take multiple signals and pass them together in a single connection which reduces the need for maintaining and using an open HTTP connection to save bandwidth.
