- What would you count as a victory?

This week went great, I felt like having completed our MVP so early that we were able to do some really cool things on our site. I enjoyed working on a larger team, with more time to work on a project that a day or 2. You can really see how big a project can become when you have a solid team. I found that each individual having a piece of the project is more productive than traditional pair programming. We would have never have been able to get as far as we did working in pair looking at the same thing. I found the Google calendar API difficult to work with and ended up having to swap to a more junior developer friendly API. Which ended up working really well. Overall, I found this project to be very fun and I feel like we as a team accomplished a great thing.
