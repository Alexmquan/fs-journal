## Questions

1. What is a ***Github action*** and how do they work?

A github action is an action that is created in your Github repository using one or more text files called workflows. They can handle common build tasks. They can be responsive to certain actions that happen on your repository. 

2. What benefits do Github actions provide?



3. What types of ***trigger actions*** can a workflow use? What do they do?

Push requests, pull requests, and schedules are some of the more common events that trigger actions. A push is when you commit a change to the repository, a pull is when you accept changes into your code, and scheduling an event is when you define a schedule for your workflow to run on.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

Today we completed our MVP and were able to go through another mini planning phase. We decided on which direction we wanted to go to next, and who was going to be focused on what work. I really liked how we decided to break up the work. Each of us took a large Ideal that we wanted to include and focused on that while the 4th person worked on fixing things and editing what was already there. Im sure that this will work out for us.
