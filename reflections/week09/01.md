## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We are using the NPS API, google Maps APi, emailing enabling sites, and Calendar plugins to build our sites features. 

2. What went well so far?

So far we have been able to get pretty close to our MVP. We have been very good at keeping a good work pace and being able to accomplish what we need to. Everyone is working well together and we are able to figure out what direction we are going and what changes need to be made. 

3. What would you do differently? Why?

If I could do something differently, I would have maybe spent more time working on the figma. We spent a lot of time trying to figure out design changes in the middle of our project rather than in the beginning during the planning phase. I feel like this could have been avoided a little better if we had focused more on it earlier.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

We have accomplished our MVP and can now work on our Ideal product and ideas. This opens up our group to another planning session to go over the details of our next sprint. We have been having a standup everyday at least once a day to discuss how the day went and what we are planning on working on the following day. This has been working well for our team and has helped us stay on track, stay focused, and all on the same page.
