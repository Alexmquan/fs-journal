## Questions

1. What function does a ***developer portfolio*** provide?

A developer profile provides increased visibility and authority. Which means that it'll give recruiters/ future employers a deeper look into what you can do. It gives you something to show for your experience rather than a previous job which is important when getting into the industry. You can showcase your skills in a particular subject. And it can help separate yourself from other candidates when job hunting. 

2. What makes a developer portfolio effective?

A developer profile can is effective when you have variety. Showing that you can handle a lot of different subjects simultaneously will show your skill. You must build quality products. Having 20 projects that are low grade will look less impressive then just a few high quality verbose projects. 

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your portfolio? Why?

I will most likely put any project that I have created with Vue in my portfolio because I feel that they are the most rounded and showcase what I know as to date. I may go back and rewrite some of the other projects that I have done using only MVC but maybe attempt them on a new framework such as React or with Vue. Maybe I will build my own APIs for those projects and show it off as a full project.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

Todays subject was planning. I enjoyed working in a larger team. It allows for more ideas, more heads being put towards problems, and it allowed for more separation of duties. It was exciting seeing a website being thought of and put together in a single day.
