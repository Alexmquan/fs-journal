## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

The three main types of testing in VUE are Unit testing, component testing, and End-to-end testing. 

Unit testing provides the testing of individual units of code in isolation. It will allow developers to build confidence in their code. 
Component testing is testing the Vue components after they have been mounted to the DOM in order to determine if they are actually working. 
End-to-end testing is useful because it allows you to test your application across multiple browsers.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

I believe that the most useful testing method would be the component testing because you are able to see how you piece of code or component actually works on the DOM. 

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

I think that the least useful would be the end-to-end testing because it is only used to check if you program has 100% browser coverage. This seems like a resource intensive way of doing thigns and while it seems important I believe that the tradeoff is not worth it. Especially when compared to how much use the other 2 tests provide.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

Today we chose a different way of pair programming as discussed yesterday. We decided to work on individual components of the project but working side by side. If anyone had an issue that they needed help with the other partner would look at the problem and they would work on it together until it was solved, then returned to the individual work. The amount of progress that we were able to achieve today was much greater than the previous day. Spirits felt much higher and we were able to see the fruits of our labor.
