## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

Communication on a small team is important because the more communication a team has throughout the day, the less meetings they need to do and they can also keep those meetings shorter. 

2. What adjustments from traditionally sized scrum teams need to be made to use the Agile methodology effectively in a small team?

You may need to increase communication amongst the team, to decrease meetings. You will need to have a results-oriented mindset when tackling Scrum sprints. This may involve developers putting on different hats and work outside just their set responsibilities.

3. What is the ***unattainable triangle***? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

The unattainable triangle is the paradox that separates the speed of development and the quality of the work delivered. The three sides/tradeoffs of the triangle are Good service Cheap wonâ€™t be Fast, Good service Fast wonâ€™t be Cheap and Fast service Cheap wonâ€™t be Good.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

It was nice seeing our team close up the planning phase of our project today. We got our review and were able to see some mistakes that we made or additional features that we may have overlooked. We were then able to implement those features into our design. We also set up a Scrum Master and Product owner and set expectations for work and breaks in the next 2 weeks.
