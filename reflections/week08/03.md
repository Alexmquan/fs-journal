## Questions

1. What is ***software development testing***?

Software testing is testing your code to make sure it does what it supposed to without problems. 

2. What are the benefits of testing in software development?

Some benefits of testing in software development are that you will have more peace of mind, confidence, efficiency, and documentation. You ill have peace of mind because you will know that your piece of code has been tested and you can trust that it will meet the standards that you have set in place. The confidence you will build by pushing you to think more about the potential edge cases that you will need to have before it goes to QA. YOu will become more effiecient because you will be able to run your test much faster than QA will be able to since yours will be unit tests rather than an end-to-end suite.

3. What are some potential drawbacks of testing in software development?

SOme potential drawbacks for testing in software development are that creating the tests will take more time to build all the tests. This will also equate to more money spent developing the product, at least on the development side. But it will be more effiecient overall.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

Today was the first day we were able to code and we tried doing a conventional pair programming with 2 drivers and 2 callers. We found this approach to be inefficient for what we were attempting to do. It was helpful in some ways but with so much project to do it didn't feel like we were able to accomplish as much as we should've. We also were finding several issues in our design and UML structure that required a bit of rework. Today was a good feeler for how we should move forward.
