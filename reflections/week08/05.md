## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


This week has been going well. I feel like I have been able to really push my knowledge and build something bigger than I have before. We have been working great as a team and I am very proud of what we have been able to accomplish. I feel like I have been struggling a bit with the pair programming. It just doesn't seem like I know enough to truly guide someone else with the same if not better understanding of the material that we are working on. It just feels like one person if programming and Im just watching. Overall it has been a good week though and I feel like we are really coming together as a team and the website we are going to have completed at the end will be beautiful.
