## Questions

1. In simple terms what is ***timeboxing***?

It is breaking up your time into small "boxes" and if your time extends past that box to move on to the next box regardless.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

I will be implementing practice and and adapting, creating an action list, and eating the frog.
1) practicing and adapting is how ill become better at timeboxing. just a little improvement every day with consistency will help me learn to timebox more effectively. 
2) creating an action list will help me not worry about not completing the items of my timebox. I will set aside time every day to complete things that ran over their timeboxes.
3) I will "eat the frog" so ill start with the hardest thing everyday which will give me confidence knowing that everything else will be easier in the day.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? x

I would have benefited from timeboxing as a kid, between figuring out when to do my chores, do my homework, and being able to set aside free time for myself. I could have set some time aside for each chore that I needed to do knowing which ones needed to be done and then I could have organized the rest of my time better for myself.
