Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

The beginning of the week I felt really good about and didn't have any issue with. Once we started including virtuals and connecting the front end and the backend things got a bit more difficult. Also intergrating the auth0 into the code and connecting user Ids and account Ids with things proved to be difficult as well. The hackathon was a lot of work but I really enjoyed the team I was working with and the work was very rewarding. It was great seeing how our front end and backend connected and getting that data manipulated on the page. Im really looking forward to learning vue though and streamlining a lot of these processes.
