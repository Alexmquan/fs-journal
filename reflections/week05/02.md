## Questions

1. What are the three types of data relationships?

The three types of data relationships are 1-to-1, 1-to-many, and many-to-many. 1-to-1 relationships means there is only one movement to be made. 1-to-many relationships mean 1 object can access many others while those others can only access the one original object. And many-to-many relationships mean the multiple objects have relationships with multiple other object, sometimes with the sam objects. They can be sorted with foreign keys.

2. What are the benefits of traditional ***linking*** relationships over ***embedding*** relationships?

Embedding is good when you only want a single read function to happen to access your data. Linking is when you give your object a foreign key to access the data from outside of the initial object called. Embedding is the preferred method because it is more efficient.

3. When modeling data, it's important to consider how a user will use and filter that data. How does this affect the way you model a ***many-to-many*** relationship? 

You may want to use one way embedding which can categorize one side of objects with references for easier filtering. You could also use a third collection to manage your objects if you need to sort it down more specifically.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

As always I enjoyed doing gregslist because it is basically doing the same thing 3 times. By the third try I barely had to use my references.
