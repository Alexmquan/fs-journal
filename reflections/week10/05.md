# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


This week felt like it went by fast as far as learning how to use C# and already implementing everything we have learned with node.js into it. Its nice to see how once you've learned how to do a process one way, learning how to do it in another language can be as easy as a week to get to the same point.
