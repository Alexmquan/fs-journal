## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

Information in rows are complete objects, i.e, they contain the details of each property that is inclusive to that object. The columns are specific properties. They organize the details of each property that belongs on all of the objects. 

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called "characters" with the values "name, age, description" as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE 
  IF NOT EXISTS characters(
    id INT NOT NULL primary key AUTO_INCREMENT, 
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    age VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    createdAt DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updatedAt DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  ) default charset utf8mb4;

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
Delete for table-name is used to remove something from the table. And DROP TABLE is used to remove all data including the table itself from your SQL database.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Today we were able to begin the project. I like that the references we have this week are helpful but dont just give you the answer. Its nice to have to really think about how the database tabeles are actually formed.
