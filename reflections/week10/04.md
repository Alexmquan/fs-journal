## Questions

1. What is an ***Enum***, and what are some use cases for them?

In CSharp, enums are used to represent constants with symbolic names for integral values. They are strongly typed, which means that each enum has its own specific type. Even if two enums have the same member values, they cannot be assigned to each other if they are of different types.

2. How can you modify an Enum?

You would modify its base type and members. 

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far? (if you have not yet, give an example of how you could.)

We have used enums in our backend schemas, to include multiple values to a single data type.

Today we learned how to create many-to-many relationships with C#. I find it to be easier than using virtuals in node.js.
