## Questions

1. What is a `List` in C#?

A list is a collection of strongly typed objects. These can accessed using their index. WHich is how the list are manipulated. 

2. What `List` methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

I think I will be using the list methods list[index], list.Contains, and List.find. I think I would use the list[index] because it would allow you to pinpoint specific List items and replace them if needed. I would use the index.contains because I would use it to find all of the items that contain a field that I am looking for. And I would use the List.find So i could find the first value that matches the provided value.

3. How would you retrieve an item from a `List`? What method could you use?

You could use the method list.find to find the first instance of the item that you are looking for.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I enjoyed using gregslist to solidify what ive learned on C-Sharp. This week has been fast paced and its nice to have greglist to establish the fundamentals. I think that I like C-sharp more than node.js in that I believe that it is more direct but I think that it will take more than this week to get to where I was in node.js
