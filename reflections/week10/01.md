## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

The three categories of data types are the value type, reference type, and pointer type. The value type holds a data value within its own memory space. They directly  contain values. 
The reference type is different than the value type in regards to that it stores the address of where the value is being stored instead of directly storing the value. It essentially is just holding a pointer to another memory location. The Pointer type does not inherit from an object and there are no conversions between pointer types and object.

2. What are the ***value-type*** data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

The value type data types hold the data value directly in its own memory space. It is different than javascript because it makes a copy of that variable when called in another method but instead of keeping that value the same across the site if that copy variable is changed then only the copy value is changed and not the original.

3. In your own words how do ***reference types*** get stored in memory? How does this differ from value types?

Its essentially storing just the location of where the variable is stored, instead of actually storing the variable. So instead of having to constantly store the same variable, you can just pull the information from wherever it is actually stored. This is different that a value type because the value type is actually storing the data, so you would call it directly rather than through a pointer.
