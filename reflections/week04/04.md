Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I enjoyed todays assignment but I wished I could have gotten further then I did. I had forgotten that in order to get the API to respond properly to editing, that you need to replace your own elements with the updated one using indexing and splicing. Otherwise you will need to manually refresh the which creates a bad user experience. Partner programming can be hit or miss. I think its important to figure out each others strengths first so you can determine which partner will be be better at what.
