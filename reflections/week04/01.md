> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of 'callback hell'?

Callback hell is when functions will be called one after another, after another, etc. Some signs are when you see functions within functions within functions and you see a lot of '})' all in a row. You can also tell that you're getting into callback hell when you have unnamed functions. This will cause your code to not hoist those functions.

2. What does ***asynchronous*** mean, and how are callbacks involved?

Asynchronous code is when your code functions at the same time as other code without waiting for any other code to initiate before it. Callbacks are used with asynchronous code by giving your code a function to call upon once the code that is calling it is complete rather than waiting for the code to finish to proceed. 

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid/fix 'callback hell.'

You can avoid callback hell by keeping your code shallow by not putting all your functions within one function and by calling those function from outside of the parent function.  You must modularize, which is splitting your code up into smaller pieces. The third way is to handle every single error. The more popular method is to use node.js style where your first argument in your callback is reserved for error. It allows for you to always remember your errors.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Accessing APIs is very useful. Manipulating them is a bit challenging. I had trouble trying to figure out how to make the questions order random. Ill be trying to figure that out this weekend I think, but I believe its challenging, not impossible for me to figure out.
