## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?
The 3 states of a Promise are Pending, Resolved, and Rejected. The pending state is when the promise has been made and is waiting for it to be upheld. The Resolved is when the promise has been upheld and you have received the results that you wanted. And the rejected state is when your promise could not be fulfilled as requested.

2. How do `Promise`s seek to resolve the issues of 'callback hell'?

You can use chaining and attach multiple request to one catch(rejected state).

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

The 'then()' method is what happens if the promise has been resolved. If the promise is not upheld and something goes wrong then the 'catch()' method takes effect.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I really enjoy the three different areas of gregslist. It makes learning the material easier I feel like. Its nice to see the first round completed by the instructor so that way you can visually see how everything is supposed to be. Then the second one you can use the first one for reference which is important, otherwise I feel like I would be completely lost. Especially so early in the week. And then by the third time I can use the other two much less for reference and I feel like it becomes more muscle memory.
