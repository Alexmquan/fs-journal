## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `async`/`await`?

To solve the the problems that promises caused when they were introduced. It was a better way to use promises so the syntax was more synchronous functioning while actually being asynchronous.

2. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

You must prepend it and the calling code will stop until the promise has been resolved or rejected. You prepend it by adding async to the function.

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `async`/`await`?

Since it solves the original problem the promises came with, the code is much easier to read. You can chain multiple async functions in series pretty easily like we have been doing with our controllers and service files. It also makes debugging easier because the compiler treats it like regular code.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Introducing the import API made sense but the part that I was having trouble with was getting the information to crossover from one to the other.
