# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.


## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


My biggest struggle this week was probably working with both import APIs and export APIs together and getting the information from one to the other in regard to their formatting changing. I feel like I was able to figure it out later in the week. Formatting the model and using different API data was also pretty difficult and learning how to manipulate that data with Gets and Statics within the model was tricky too. I enjoyed everything we learned this week and am ready for the next week. Im going to try and stay on top of everything we are doing this week and attempt a few stretch goals if there is time. I want to make more of those side things we have been working on easier to do without referencing.
