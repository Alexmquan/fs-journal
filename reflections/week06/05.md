# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


This week was a struggle every day. I feel like these concepts were a large leap in difference than the others in comparison. Everything else felt like it was very close to the other and you only had to make small adjustments to make them work. This week brought in a much different type of framework to use as far as terminology goes as well as some of the functions. I think the hardest part of the week for me was figuring out how to get what I wanted to have reactivity in the way that I wanted. Props are still confusing for me and how they pass data. And where things are supposed to be placed in what spots in the script.
