## Questions

1. What is a **nested route***?

A nested route allows you to move from page to page when running certain functions. You can set up your page to react to certain UI interactions that will bring you to certain other pages.

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

You may use a nested route when you attempt to run a function that will take you to another page upon completion. You can do this by using a nested route to do a router.push method.

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

You can pass parameters through nested routes which may be useful when trying to pass a specific ID that will be used to populate data on the end page that is specific to what you were doing on the previous page.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment


I enjoyed this group assignment today. Working with pair programming is much easier when there are components to work in rather than 2 people trying to work in the same files. When there are many compenents to work on each person can work on their specific section without running into merge conflicts. Todays assignment was a great learning experience in modifying accounts/profiles.
