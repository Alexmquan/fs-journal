## Questions

2. What are some benefits of Component-Based Architecture?

The components can update individually without having to update the DOM as a whole or refresh the webpage. You can reuse the components. The components exist within the same level as all associated logic and methods.

3. What are some drawbacks to Component-Based Architecture?
