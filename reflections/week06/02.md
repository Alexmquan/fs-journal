Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Gifted is always a challenge for me. I have trouble getting my page to be responsive, also ive never been able to get the giphy api to sync up with my page. If I have time this weekend after the checkpoint I would like to revisit this project to try and fix it once I know the lessons of later in the week. I do like the different types of challenges that this project brings such as the uncovering of an element, the search bar into an API and only being able to set the gifts as true.
