## Questions

1. What are ***lifecycle hooks***? What are lifecycle hooks used for?

Lifestyle hooks are components that you can place your code into that, depending on which hook you use, determines when your code will run. they are sequential and also reactive based on what you are doing. One hook will not run until the next one is complete. 

2. How have you used lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?

We have used the onMount lifestyle hooks in our projects. This lifestyle hook runs right before the generation of the page. Its basically like how we used to use the constructor in the controller and have functions run right on rendering of the page.

3. What are ***mounting hooks***? When might you use them?

Mounting hooks are used to access or modify the DOM before or after the initial render of the page. This means that they are automatic and will not be called upon from a users interaction but only on the rendering of the page initially.
