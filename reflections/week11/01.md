## Questions

1. What does ***inheritance*** accomplish for us in C#?

Inheritance allows us to increase code reuse. You can use a derived class on any base class. You can use it to create abstract classes to create a common set of properties.

2. How does ***member inheritance*** work in C#? Does a `Class` inherit all members of the base `Class`?

It refers to the way classes inherit properties and methods from their base class. A class does inherit all members of a base class but they can be overridden.

3. How does ***accessibility*** affect inheritance?

It determines which members of a base class are accessible to another class.
