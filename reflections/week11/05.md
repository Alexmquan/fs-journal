- What would you count as a victory?


This week has been a little nerve racking and also I couldn't wait to get the final to get it over with. I feel prepared for this and I know I will be able to finish this and make it look good. Im still a little shakey on the MySQL requests but I will work on it some more and I will be able to finish that as well.
