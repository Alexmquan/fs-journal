Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Overall I have very much enjoyed this course and an sad to be leaving it. I have enjoyed the people and experiencing growth as a group. We have all have the same shortcomings and triumphs, and it has been great to share that with others. I hope they open up a react course so I can go through that one as well. This has been great for me to get back into the learning mindset and to show myself that i can accomplish this kind of work that previously, I wasn't entirely sure if it was for me. I plan on using all my time and just bulldozing this Final Project this next week. If i give it 70+ hours, there is no way it wont look good.
