## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

 You can use one of these three ways to write a function: A function declaration, a function expression, and an arrow function expression. When using a function declaration the function declaration is hoisted to the top of its scope. A function expression however is different, they are not hoisted to the top of their scope therefore they cannot be used before they are defined. An arrow function expression is like a function expression except it has a shorter syntax and it does not create its own `this` value. 

2. What is the main difference between ***parameters*** and ***arguments***? 

A parameter are the values names created in the function definition and arguments are the values sent to the function to be executed. The parameter names will stay the same but you can invoke a function with different arguments used at different times, with different names.

3. What are ***higher-order functions***? Can you provide an example?

a high-order function is a function that takes other functions as its parameter or returns a function. Such as a draw function that is used as a mediator between other functions and your HTML. such as we used in todays afternoon assignment.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Todays assignment was definitely the most challenging one so far for me. The higher-order functions proved to be harder to follow than expected. They are definitely really cool to use once you understand them. Its nice to reuse the same code for multiple things. array() methods are also very handy and save time on coding.
