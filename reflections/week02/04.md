## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan for your application before starting to write the code?

Some benefits to making a plan before starting writing your code are that you can think out more complex parts of your code before you get stuck in them, you can figure out things that may or may not work, you can figure out the process and how to break the code up into section. It ensures that you get high quality code.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

You can find answers by googling it. But you should be wary of using things you find and do not 100% understand. You can ask a colleague or mentor for assistance. 

3. What coding mistakes would you be most likely to make? What advice from this article do you find most helpful?

The coding mistakes that I would most likely make is seeing existing code and assuming that it is correct because it has been there for a long time. At least until I understand what I am looking at in its entirety. I think some advice that I really thought was helpful in this article are that I need to write efficient and good tests so that was I do not need to constantly check to make sure my code is working manually every few lines of code. I also liked the thought that we should sometimes give up on something if it is starting to seem like a pipedream task. Otherwise you may end up wasting a lot of time on something that may never work instead of looking for a new solution.
