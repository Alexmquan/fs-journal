## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style?

You can use the console.log() method to display data straight from javascript to the console. This is useful when you are trying to see if certain data is properly passing where you want it to. It ensures that you can get to a certain point in your javascript and that specific data is also getting to that point. You can write directly into the console from the console tab. This is useful for debugging.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS, and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

You would use the Elements tab to see the breakdown of the HTML and CSS. You can edit your page directly without having to swap back and forth between your IDE and your webpage. The changes you make there are also temporary so you can adjust things and test to see what certain changes will do without actually changing your code. You can also see the box model layout on your entire page which will be useful when seeing why certain parts of your page are acting a certain way.

3. Instead of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

By using the sources tab. There you can directly edit your code or you can use the Javascript Debugging Pane. This pane will allow you to add breakpoints into your code and see a step-by-step breakdown of how your code is communicating. This is useful because it allows you to see where the miscommunication is in realtime as your code runs line by line.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

One major takeaway from today was being being able to process multiple arrays through a single draw function. I had a lot of trouble getting it to work with each part in its own function but once i put them all in a single draw, i was able to get my afternoon assignment to work.
