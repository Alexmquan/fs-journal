## Questions

1. What is ***scope***?

Scope is the range of where things are available. For javascript there are local scopes and global scopes. Local scopes are bound within the function that they are declared while global scopes are a available everywhere.

2. What is ***Hoisting***?

Hoisting is where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope but are initialized as undefined. This can be problematic because if the variable is defined twice it will take the second declaration which could cause problems if you were expecting one output and get the other one.

3. In what cases might you use `let` vs. `const` vs. `var`?

You would use `let` when you want a variable that can be initialized after it has been declared. You would use a `const` when you you need a variable that will be initialized at time of being declared. It is a more concrete variable. You are still allowed to change the properties of a valueYou would use `var` when you want a variable that can be redefined at a later time if need be. However you need to use caution as you may receive a different output than expected. `let` and `const` are the preferred variables to use due to their block scope capabilities.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Todays assignment was a good introduction to javascript. It nice to finally be able to add some function to our webpages. Functions are a great way to make a reusable chunk of code. I am looking forward to tomorrows lesson to see what else we can do with javascript.
