> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the ***observer pattern*** seek to solve?

It seeks to solve data binding by using reuseable code. This promotes loose coupling.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

The event observer use the three mechanisms: subscribe, unsubscribe, and broadcast. The subscribe method adds new observable events to the event observer. The unsubscribe method removes those observable events. And the broadcast method executes all events with data bound to the event observer. 

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template, and reflect on the `Proxy` objects from yesterday and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the DOM.

Using the built in event listener(proxy) is an effective way of 'observing' what your data is doing and reacting to the changes accordingly. It will listen for changes in the assigned element (target) and complete whatever task you assign to it (handler). You can create layers of automation and encapsulation doing this.
