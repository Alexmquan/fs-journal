## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the ***handler***?

two common operations area the 'get' and 'set' operations. These create custom logic specified by the handler object. The get operator returns the value stored in the key of an object. and the set operator takes 3 arguments - the object, the property being accessed and the  value being set for that property.

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every `get` to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

You need to make sure you give it an object and a parameter and makes sure you return the value stored in the key of an object.

3. What are some of the benefits of the `Proxy` object that we are using in our structure for applications?

They create custom functionality to basic operations that can be performed on an object. They are helpful when trying to make any object changes. They can change the original objects value without having to manually do it.
