## Questions

1. What problem does using ***exports*** solve?

They solve the problem where HTML has to go through multiple .js files all at once which can cause latency to your webpage. With exports you can only take the parts that you want when you can them by `exporting them either individually or in modules. 

2. How does `export` differ from `export default`?

an export can send individual lines of code to your parent .js file. This can cause problems because the child .js file can effect the parents js file. The export default binds lines together so that way you don't get outputs that you are not expecting.


3. What is a benefit of using the "module" system?

Benefits of using modules is that your code can be compartmentalized better which can make troubleshooting easier, debugging easier, and can increase performance. It makes it easier to locate what you are looking for because you know what job it is supposed to be doing so it narrows down your search.
