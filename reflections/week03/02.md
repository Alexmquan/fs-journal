## Questions

1. What is the purpose of ***Encapsulation***?

It restricts access to data from outside of the "bundle" that they are contained in. IT helps prevent bugs that come from sharing a mutable state. It keeps your data from becoming so tightly woven that making changes would break your code. 

2. What were some of the problems with ***closures*** and the ***underscore prefix*** convention?

The underscores were not meant for users of APIs to be able to call directly, that is not their purpose. However many new developers use the underscore properties for uses other than internal use. This causes breaking changes. This is creating more surface API than neccesary which makes your API more vulnerable to hackers. Closures give data privacy, they enclosed inner functions within outer functions except through the objects privileged methods. 

3. How do we create private variables in an ES6 `Class`? Why would you do this?

You can create private variables using the underscore convention, and closures. It contains the data within a function that is within a function so that its variables cannot be accessed from outside of the parent function. They are declared outside of the original function so the use  cannot interact with it.
