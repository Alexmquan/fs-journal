Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.


## Prompts
- What went well this week?

- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


This week was a bit harder than the others. The concept that was the most challenging was figuring out which js files completed which tasks. The model seemed pretty simple at first but with the introduction of static, get, and set. and how those can be manipulated together it became on of the more confusing concepts to figure out. I felt like by the end of the week I had a good grasp on which js files completed which tasks and how they interact with each other. I also feel like this week I found the importance of pseudocode and how it helps me piece together how everything works together by writing it out in simpler terms and i could build my code off of that. Could I build greglist completely off of memory at this moment without references? No. But i feel like im almost there with the projects we have been doing and hopefully by next week I will be able to do this. Thats my goal atm.
