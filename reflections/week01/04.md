## Questions

1. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***? 

Wireframing is used so you can have a clear picture of what your pages will look like before you build them. You can see how components will work together and also what will not work together. Its basically a rough draft for your website. They allow room for feedback before spending time, money, and resources on a product that may have been better off changed at an earlier stage in production.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wireframes, and why is each one useful?

 There are low, mid, and high fidelity wireframes. Low fidelity wireframes can be useful when attempting to make a quick decision or when trying to show a concept rather than a final product. Mid-fidelity wireframes can be useful when showing stakeholders or decision makers what could be possible but allowing room for changes. This method is great because it doesn't pressure anyone to go along with an idea thats been processed to a level that seems like it can't be changed. High-fidelity wireframes are useful because they can focus on much more structured details. Such as interactive elements of your webpages or the finer details of specific features.

3. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I think wireframes are a very good use of time. It is as important as creating a blueprint for a house before starting to build it. Especially when there are so many different variations of wireframes at all different levels and cost. I think not using wireframes would prove to be a negative towards anybodys final product.
