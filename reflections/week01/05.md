# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I found that I am really enjoying the design process of web development. This week was fun but challenging. Formatting HTML was not very difficult but CSS was a bit more challenging. One thing that I have been having trouble with is flex classes in bootstrap. As well as formatting images to the way I would want them. One thing that suprised me was how difficult some parts of the checkpoint were for me. I had trouble figuring out where to use d-flex and when not to use it. But that challenge helped me better understand the parents/child relationships. Which I would call a victory.
