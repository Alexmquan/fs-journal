## Questions

1. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

a pseudo-class is a keyword that is attached to a selector. It allows styling to a element when it is focused upon. Some of the more common ones that i think we will use are: `:hover` `:active` `:checked` `:link` `:nth-of-type()`. 
 
2. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is the value that your selectors and elements have. If one selector has a stronger value then another then it will override the latter of the 2. You can use this to your advantage when you need to make a change to a more specific element. 

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?

Using the `!important` feature gives an element too much specificity and can create issues in the future because it will override and other changes that you are trying to make. If you were to undo the !important feature too late in development it could cause a domino effect of issues do to the reliance of said feature.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment.

FlexBox is great for keeping your page dynamic! It allows for elements to change as the page shrinks and grows. It is also helpful to move elements around its container as you see fit.

Wireframing is a necessary step in the planning process. The more detail that you can get into your wireframing process, the better you can visualize your project.

It is important to use the appropriate sizing methods so your webpage can be dynamic. If you were to use px for everything then your page would not be user friendly and your page would look awful. Using values such as em, rem, vh, vw, and %, will give you a much better page.
