## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip for improving your design? How does it benefit your site?

My favorite tip for improving design is using shadow instead of adding a border. I like the way it makes texts and boxes look like they are sitting on the page rather than just emphasized with a border.

2. Compile a couple of resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

I like the site https://coolors.co/. Its a site that helps find color palettes that work well together.

I also like the site  https://www.canva.com/learn/the-ultimate-guide-to-font-pairing/. This site shows you how different fonts work in different settings. This can be useful when you are trying to determine which font would work best on your page.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

I think a good website design will keep visitors longer and draw them back to your page. It will keep them moving about your site so they can see what else is there. You can convey the effort that you put into your product or the mood that you are trying to set.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Todays assignment was a great intro into the power of Bootstrap. You can build beautiful webpages quickly and with minimal styling. 

One function that I liked particularly with Bootstrap is the grid system. It removes a lot of tediousness from the building process.

The ability to scale your project down with simple class adjustments is also a really helpful feature that makes bootstrap a great framework to use.
