## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

 We use Git in order for multiple developers to be able to see each others work and avoid coding conflicts. It is also used for version control and for a detailed, timestamped log of your work.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

The benefits of having multiple branches is to allow you to make changes to the code in a separate branch and see how those changes affect the code without changing the actual code, such as in a test environment. Upon acceptance of the separate branch, you can then "merge" the branch with another branch in order to solidify changes to your project.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

Git is used for version control and to track changes in source code. You can see the entire history of code changes done in a project and you can revert back to previous versions of that code. While GitHub hosts GIT repositories and is useful for collaboration on projects where you can see what each developer is currently working on.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment.

Todays takeaways are as follows:
1. Github is an useful tool that allows for better oversight on projects, especially ones that include multiple developers working on the same one. It allows for trackable version control so you can revert back to a specific point in a project which will be helpful when you are unsatisfied with changes made.
2. Using powershell and cmd prompt to navigate through and manipulate files is a quicker, more effective method than doing so manually.
